# Twist-The-Deck
A spin-the-bottle, pick a card, sexy "tease" game currently being built for use on XToys.app.

-insert Xtoys link to Tease-

This Tease is a game meant to be played in-person with other people. Consider if a version of spin-the-bottle (where the bottle is spun with RNG by the Tease).  Only instead of Truth or Dare, a kissing game, or 7 minutes in heaven, you do activities depending on the random draw of a "card" by the Tease. There are multiple decks (planned), from which you can select from, and use any and all of them in the same game, as well as the ability to add your own custom cards to play with. At the start of the Game, you will also be able to select what toys and objects you have access to (to remove cards that require toys you don't have available), as well as remove activities which are hard limits for the group playing (it's expected that everyone agrees to the same limits/boundaries while playing for "fair" play). Anyone playing can be tasked to play with anyone else, and there's no code to make sure you only do "straight" or "dominant" activities.  If you're not open to that or you're preferences are too strict to allow you to switch/flip in the spirit of fun, you shouldn't play this game.

When engaging in any activities listed on a card, please know what you're doing and be safe. If you don't feel safe to perform a task, please draw a new card instead of risking harming someone. If you're playing this, you're trying to have fun and feel good; so don't be a doof and send someone to the hospital!
